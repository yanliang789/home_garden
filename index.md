### Project Motivation and description
```markdown
As the coronavirus lockdown laws keep inside the boundaries of our home, there has been an explosion of interest in producing our own food.
Garden retails have been recent big sellers through outdoor outlets like Home Depots, Lowes, Ace hardware. I am a home vegetable garden fan. 
All the vegetables on my table are grown by myself. I want to encourage people to grow healthy vegetable at home.
- I will use dataset from Census.gov to show the rise of retail sales during COVID-19. To see the overall the impact of retail sales. 
- The main objective of this project is to talk about the trend of Home gardens. I will use a line chart to show the rise in Gardening Retail During COVID-19.
- Show and compare the increasing of garden sales and the other increase sales using dataset from Census.gov.
- To show the rise of the price for vegetables and fruits to encourage people to grow their own vegetable and fruit in home garden.
- Home garden also can help people in physical and mental wellbeing.
